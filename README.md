# E-commerce
This is an e-commerce website for selling watches. However, this is not a real shop, it's only a school project.

The Testing directory will eventually be removed.

To run the project locally:

1. Activate the virtual environment by opening the e-commerse folder and running: source venv-timezone/bin/active
2. Go into the Project folder and execute the file "run.py"
3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000>
4. (ctrl c) to close the server
